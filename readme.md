# Minette
A discord.js bot base thing, it works i suppose?

## things it can do
* **Ping**: embed that just shows if its infact alive (ms time todo)
* **Say**: says what it does, talk as the bot. requires userID to be included in *commandID* or *manage messages*
* **Verify**: verify server members by a command, requires *verifyChannel* and *verifyRole* to work
* **Response Module**: turned off by default, make it go scream at people if someone says a thing.
* **game**: remake of "its okay i guess" to fit with discord, now with messages
* **blackjack**: its blackjack. (broken)

**Requires Manage Messages**
* **RecordBan, RecordMute, Note, RecordWatchlist**: requires *Manage Messages* role applied to user to work, might hiccup if also not given *Manage Messages* to the bot as it uses it to clean up afterwards. Can be used to record moderation actions.  
* **Strike**: Counts Strikes against people.
* **Records**: Lists records of a specific user

**Requires Administrator**
* **EmbedUpdate**: produce and update embeds, can be changed in *config/embeds*

    "name" : "here are the very awesome rules",
    "content" : "1. dont do something?? \n 2. dont do another thing",
    "image": "https://example.com/image.png",
    "color": "#B00B69"
}   
```
* **Id**: Where you want to place this embed (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)
* **Name**: the title of your embed
* **Content**: __**Line breaks will break json formating, use \n to line break!**__ content of your embed
* **Image**: image of your embed
* **Color**: color of your embed


## Adding Embeds
1. Create a folder in *./config/embeds* with the channel id of the channel you'd like to use
2. Create embeds using the template above or provided
3. Use embedupdate, thats it.
